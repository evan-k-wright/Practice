    </div>

    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the language used to code websites. HTML is the skelital bone structure of the wbsite. All of the words and pictues you see are done with HTML. It is the start of making a website. </p>

     <p>When you fist think of coding, is's probably something that you think you will never be able to learn, do or remember. But it is ataully really easy. And the more time you spend with it, the easy and more fun it gets.</p>

    <p>CSS is also a web coding language. CSS gives the webste its look. It adds the color, the sizing of pictures. Fonts to the text. Without CSS, your website would look very boring. </p>
